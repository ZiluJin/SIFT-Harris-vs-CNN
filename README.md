# SIFT-Harris-vs-CNN
This project compares traditional computer vision methods (SIFT, Harris + SIFT + BoW + SVM) with a lightweight CNN model on CIFAR-10 and iCubWorld1.0 datasets for image classification. It includes accuracy evaluation, parameter tuning, and analysis of generalization and robustness.
